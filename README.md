# faa-api

Updated 11/15/2022

Collection of Jupyter notebooks containing methods for pulling data from various endpoints centered around fly.faa.gov. Some interesting stats available that for now I am mostly just logging daily for later analysis. 

Current notebooks:
- aadc_endpoint.ipynb : Methods for scraping the Airport Arrival Demand Chart endpoint (https://www.fly.faa.gov/aadc/)
- delay_status_endpoint.ipynb (incomplete) : Methods for querying the delay status endpoint (https://nasstatus.faa.gov/api/airport-status-information)

Upcoming:
- Implementing NASS map API's (see https://nasstatus.faa.gov/map) and more visual representation of data
- Documentation of advisories endpoint (https://www.fly.faa.gov/adv/advAdvisoryForm.jsp)
